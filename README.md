# UQA: Corpus for Urdu Question Answering

## Overview
UQA is a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. This dataset, generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0) using the EATS technique, aims to provide a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models.

## Dataset
The UQA dataset consists of translated contexts, questions, and answers. It includes both answerable and unanswerable questions, maintaining the structure and challenges of the original SQuAD2.0 dataset.

### Download
The dataset and fine-tuned models can be downloaded from the following link:
- [UQA Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/uqa)

## Code
This repository includes scripts used in the translation process, dataset generation, and model benchmarks. The main components are:
- Translation scripts using the EATS technique
- Evaluation scripts for model performance
- Benchmark results on models like mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5

## Model Performance

The following table summarizes the performance of various models tested on the UQA dataset. The metrics reported are Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score.

| Model           | Exact Match (EM) | F1 Score |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| mBERT           | 45.50%           | 64.72%   |
| mT5-Small       | 52.37%           | 67.24%   |
| mT5-Large       | 71.26%           | 84.20%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa     | 65.67%           | 78.00%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa-Large | 72.24%         | 84.42%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa-XL  | 74.56%           | 85.99%   |
