# UQA: Corpus for Urdu Question Answering

## Overview
UQA is a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. This dataset, generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0) using the EATS technique, aims to provide a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models.

## Dataset
The UQA dataset consists of translated contexts, questions, and answers. It includes both answerable and unanswerable questions, maintaining the structure and challenges of the original SQuAD2.0 dataset.

### Download
The dataset and fine-tuned models can be downloaded from the following link:
- [UQA Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/uqa)

## Code
This repository includes scripts used in the translation process, dataset generation, and model benchmarks. The main components are:
- Translation scripts using the EATS technique
- Evaluation scripts for model performance
- Benchmark results on models like mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5

## Model Performance

The following table summarizes the performance of various models tested on the UQA dataset. The metrics reported are Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score.

| Model           | Exact Match (EM) | F1 Score |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| mBERT           | 45.50%           | 64.72%   |
| mT5-Small       | 52.37%           | 67.24%   |
| mT5-Large       | 71.26%           | 84.20%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa     | 65.67%           | 78.00%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa-Large | 72.24%         | 84.42%   |
| XLM-RoBERTa-XL  | 74.56%           | 85.99%   |

    abstract = "This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA",
