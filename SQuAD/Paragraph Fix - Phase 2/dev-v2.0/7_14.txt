Trioxygen (O-3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O-2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O-2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O-4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. 
It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O-2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O-8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O-2 or O-3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.
